      <h2>Hi, Welcome to my Blog!!!</h2>
      <p>I'm Antonio, a second year BSc (Honours) Computing and IT student at The Open University and I'm also a professional software developer. Through self teaching, over the course of 2 years, I learned how to use CSS, HTML, Python, Javascript, React and Git. I am very passionate about all things technology and in particular web development, and creating apps with great impact. At the moment I am focusing on further improving my front-end skills but I am planning to soon be a full stack developer. When I am not coding and studying for university, I am probably working on home automation, installing something new on a raspberry pi or reading a book.</p>
