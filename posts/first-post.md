Consciousness is a complex topic that has been debated for centuries. It is not well-defined enough even for humans, let alone machines. However, some researchers suggest that AI might already be conscious to some degree, based on a mathematical theory that the universe and everything in it has physical consciousness. Others argue that machines will become conscious when they start to set their own goals and act according to them, rather than follow their programmers’ intentions.

Conscious AI is the next frontier in AI advancements that would enable machines to exhibit creativity, empathy, compassion, and meta-thinking. However, testing consciousness is hard even for humans. Consciousness is not about behavior; consciousness is about being. Our theory says that if we want to decide whether or not a machine is conscious, we shouldn’t look at the behavior of the machine but at the actual substrate that has causal power. For present-day AI systems, that means we have to look at the level of the computer chip3.
